# inm-labs-component-library

This is mostly a library of components we use internally, so if you dont really want the whole package we also have
the components as a standalone so you can pick only the one you need instead of the whole library

## Install
```
npm install --save inm-labs-component-library
```
Once you have installed the package, in your entry file of the repository (main.js) if you are using it in a Vue CLI project. Write the import command

```
import ComponentLibrary from 'inm-labs-component-library'

app.use(ComponentLibrary)
```

## Components

Options allow you to customize how the input will format the amount as you type.

| Name | Description |
| :----------------: | :-----------:  |
| `vue-amount-format-input` | Input with format for amounts |
